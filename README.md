# NgTraining

This repo is for ppracticing angular development.

Contained here is the scaffolding for a todo list application.

- There is a Todo interface which describes the shape a Todo Item should take.
- There is a data service which should handle the data
- There is a todo list component, which ought to display the todo list
- There is a json file with some initial todos

For the first stage of this project, please create a todo list that displays the todos in the todo list component. Use localstorage in place of a real backend database. The todos.json file should be the initial todos rendered, but the user should be able to add new todos, and mark existing todos as complete or delete them. Essentially, the user should be able to perform basic CRUD operations.

To get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local machine. Then run `npm install` and `ng s` in that order!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
